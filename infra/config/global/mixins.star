"""Mixin declarations

Mixins are used to define common properties that can be applied to multiple
tests.

These are the Dawn-specific mixins. Mixins shared with Chromium (e.g. for
Swarming dimensions) are pulled in via the @chromium-targets Starlark package
and are found at Chromium's //infra/config/targets/mixins.star file.
